# What is this?
My personal stock scraper using yahoo finance API.<br>
It takes the value of the stock for the first day of January from year 2000 to 2024.<br>
It allows me to see the average % gain of the stock per year and make deductions for my stock investments.
# How to use?
Input your desired stock ticker symbols(eg. AAPL for apple stock) separated vertically in the "ticker_symbols" text file.<br>
Run the python file<br>
$ python scrape.py<br>
It will process the "ticker_symbols" text file and output google sheet files as per the tickers desired.
